# Akory_hotel_Ui
This project is a hotel booking application developed in JavaScript. It allows users to search for available hotels, view room details, and make reservations for their preferred dates.

## Installation

Before you can run the server, make sure you have [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the GitHub repository:

2. Change to the project directory:


3. Install the dependencies using:

```js
npm install

```

## Database

Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up with the required tables for the project. You can find the SQL scripts in this repository [Hotel-system-eservation](https://github.com/MioraNomenjanahary/hotel-reservation-system.git)

## Running the Server

To start the server in development mode, use the command:
```js
npm run start:dev (run the server with nodemon)

or

npm run start


```

This will launch the server on the default port (e.g., 3000), and you can access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Using the Application

Once the server is up and running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to access the hotel booking application.
